* Macros are written like `macroname fnName = fnBody`
* They are no different to ordinary functions except for the fact that they also take in
*     statement's name as an argument and can introduce additional statements and/or cancel this out
* `out`, `rec`, `feature` are all macros
* It is important to note that macros do not take in token streams
* They take in the function's body
