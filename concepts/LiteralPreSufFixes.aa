* Not allowed
* Although `30_000ms` and `c"0-terminated!"` look great, it can be achieved without extra syntactic sugar:
* `30_000 * ms` and `cstr "0-terminated!"`
* ^ These don't lose much readability whilst also lightening the burden of extra syntactic sugar
* They also are less needed because custom literal conversion is allowed

* No built-in syntax for numbers even, only `_` separators

sleep (30_000 * AA.Time.Second)
